Share with me your stats html file. It does not contain your source code - it is completely safe. You can send it to my email (see my github profile).

If you cannot provide me stats html file:
1. Provide relevant section of your rollup config (at least plugins used).
2. Provide your node and dependencies versions
3. Your OS type and version
4. Screenshot of problem
